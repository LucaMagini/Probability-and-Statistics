# Probability-and-Statistics
Repository containing some data science projects regarding probability and statistics completed by me for self learning purpose.  
Everything here was written in the Jupyter Notebook environment using Python 3.  
The data used in each project can be found in the project folder.

  * ### **Probability and Statistics for Data Science**  
    
    * [Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings](https://github.com/LucaMagini/Probability-and-Statistics/blob/master/Investigating%20Fandango%20Movie%20Ratings/Investigating%20Fandango%20Movie%20Ratings.ipynb): In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest (Fandango is an online movie ratings aggregator). In this project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data in order to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's ratings system after Hickey's analysis.
    * [Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In](https://github.com/LucaMagini/Probability-and-Statistics/blob/master/Finding%20the%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise%20In/Finding%20the%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise%20In.ipynb): We're working for an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. The company want to invest some money in advertisement in order to promote their product, so our goal in this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise the product in.
    * [Mobile App for Lottery Addiction](https://github.com/LucaMagini/Probability-and-Statistics/blob/master/Mobile%20App%20for%20Lottery%20Addiction/Mobile%20App%20for%20Lottery%20Addiction.ipynb): We want to contribute to the development of a mobile app that is meant to help lottery addicts better understand their chances of winning. The scenario we're following throughout this project is fictional â€” the main purpose is to practice applying probability and combinatorics concepts in a setting that simulates a real-world scenario.
    * [Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes](https://github.com/LucaMagini/Probability-and-Statistics/blob/master/Building%20a%20Spam%20Filter%20with%20Naive%20Bayes/Building%20a%20Spam%20Filter%20with%20Naive%20Bayes.ipynb): 
In this project we are going to use the Naive Bayes algorithm to build a spam filter for SMS messages. Our first task is to "teach" the computer how to classify messages through this algorithm and we'll use a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans.
* [Winning Jeopardy](https://github.com/LucaMagini/Probability-and-Statistics/blob/master/Winning%20Jeopardy/Winning%20Jeopardy.ipynb): 
Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where patecipants answer questions to win money. It's been running for a few decades and it is a successful show. Imagine you want to compete on Jeopardy and you are looking for any edge you can get to win. In this project, we'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help you to win.
