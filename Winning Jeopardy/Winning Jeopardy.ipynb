    "Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where patecipants answer questions to win money. It's been running for a few decades and it is a successful show. Imagine you want to compete on Jeopardy and you are looking for any edge you can get to win. In this project, we'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help you to win.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file), it contains 20,000 rows , each row represent a single question. These are the columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Show Number -- the Jeopardy episode number of the show this question was in.\n",
    "* Air Date -- the date the episode aired.\n",
    "* Round -- the round of Jeopardy that the question was asked in. Jeopardy has several rounds as each episode progresses.\n",
    "* Category -- the category of the question.\n",
    "* Value -- the number of dollars answering the question correctly is worth.\n",
    "* Question -- the text of the question.\n",
    "* Answer -- the text of the answer.\n",
