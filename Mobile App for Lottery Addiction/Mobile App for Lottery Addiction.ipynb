Like other compulsive gamblers, lottery addicts soon begin spending from their savings and loans, they start to accumulate debts, and eventually engage in desperate behaviors like theft.\n",
    "\n",
    "A medical institute, that aims to prevent and treat gambling addiction, wants to build a dedicate mobile app to help lottery addicts, and our task is to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities.\n",
    "For this first version of the app, we'll focus on the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) and we'll build functions that enable users to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning ten big prize with a single ticket ?\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "* What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also consider historical data about the 6/49 lottery. [The data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) has data for 3665 drawings, from 1982 to 2018.\n",
